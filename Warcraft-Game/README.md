The third and final programming assignment received in **EC327 (Introduction to Software Programming in C++)** at Boston University. This is a simple command-line game similar to _Warcraft_, and is based on the ***Model View Controller (MVC) design paradigm***. It consists of objects located in a two-dimensional world that move around and interact in various ways. The user enters commands to tell the objects what to do, and they behave in simulated time, which advances one “tick” at a time. These objects include miners, soldiers, gold mines, and town halls, all of which are crafted using ***object-oriented programming***.
