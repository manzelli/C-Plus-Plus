The second programming assignment received in **EC327 (Introduction to Software Programming in C++)** at Boston University. Q1.cpp and funcLib.cpp contain an ***input-driven program*** where the user enters a command code corresponding to a ***mathematical operation or file I/O command***, followed by parameters of the function. The program then executes the function and returns an appropriate response. The file q1Input.txt is provided in order to test the file I/O functionality. Q2.cpp, FileFunctions.cpp, and Statistics.cpp contain a solution to a problem involving ***file I/O, arrays, and statistics***. Q3a.cpp and Q3b.cpp are solutions to ***recursion*** problems.
